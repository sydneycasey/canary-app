## Notes
```
Hello! I left some comments throughout my code, but what I chose to focus on in this challenge was getting the basic requirements working and creating a clean, user-friendly interface. I did get to write a few simple tests and implemented vue-material as a frontend framework for some design changes. Looking forward to chatting more with you about the code!
